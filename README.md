## Dependencies
The code has been tested on Ubuntu 14.04 with GTX Titan X.  
* [Cuda](https://developer.nvidia.com/zh-cn/cuda-downloads) >= 6.0
* [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) >= 2.4
* [cmake](https://cmake.org/)
## Usage
* Compile ACMM
```  
cmake .  
make
```
* Test 
``` 
Use script colmap2mvsnet_acm.py to convert COLMAP SfM result to ACMM input   
Run ./ACMM $data_folder to get reconstruction results
```

## SfM Reconstructions for Tanks and Temples Dataset
To ease comparison with other MVS methods with our method on [Tanks and Temples dataset](https://www.tanksandtemples.org/), we release our SfM reconstuctions on this dataset. They are obtained by [COLMAP](https://colmap.github.io/) and can be downloaded from [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1DTnnmJAOGt7WPXSLMysMvPTy4CUZt_TU).
