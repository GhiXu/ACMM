## SfM Outputs for Tanks and Temples Dataset
To faciliacte other MVS methods to compare with our method on Tanks and Temples dataset, we release our SfM reconstuctions on this dataset. They are obtained by COLMAP and can be downloaded from [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1DTnnmJAOGt7WPXSLMysMvPTy4CUZt_TU).
